<h1>About Me</h1>
<h3>
  Hi everyone, I'm Sarah - curious, open-minded and always searching for new things to learn. I like in San Marcos, TX where I go to School at Texas State University. In the past two years I've submerged myself in becoming a better programmer. Its very rewarding to solve a difficult problem and more intriging to ponder the thought of solving a problem thats never been solved before.
