<h3>
  Hi everyone, I'm Sarah - curious, open-minded and always searching for new things to learn. 
  I'm an Undergraduate Computer Science & Applied Mathematics at Texas State University. 
  In the past two years I've submerged myself in becoming a better programmer. I find solving 
  difficult problems in math and computer science to be very rewarding.
